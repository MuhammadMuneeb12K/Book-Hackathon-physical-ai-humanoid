  "description": "Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). In the evolving landscape of robotics, particularly with complex humanoid systems, the concept of a \"digital twin\" has become indispensable. This chapter introduces the core idea of a digital twin, its significance in robot development and deployment, and how it serves as a critical bridge between the virtual and physical worlds. Understanding digital twins is fundamental to building, testing, and optimizing humanoid robots efficiently and safely.",
