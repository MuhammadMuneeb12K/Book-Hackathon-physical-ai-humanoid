  "description": "While Gazebo excels in physics-accurate simulation, especially for ROS 2 integrated robots, there are scenarios where visual fidelity, complex scene interactions, and advanced Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) prototyping are paramount. This is where Unity, a leading real-time 3D development platform, offers distinct advantages. This chapter explores how Unity can be leveraged to create high-fidelity HRI scenes and visually rich environments for humanoid robotics, often complementing Gazebo or Isaac Sim for specific use cases.",
