### Lab 3.1.1: Setup and Run Isaac Sim Scene with a Humanoid

**Objective:** Launch Isaac Sim, create a basic scene, import a pre-built humanoid model, and ensure the simulation runs correctly.

**Prerequisites:** NVIDIA RTX GPU, NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher, and Isaac Sim installed. Basic understanding of the Omniverse Launcher.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Launch Isaac Sim:**
    *   Open NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher.
    *   Go to the "Exchange" tab, ensure Isaac Sim is installed.
    *   Go to the "Library" tab, and launch Isaac Sim. This might take a few moments.
2.  **Create a New Stage/Scene:**
    *   Once Isaac Sim loads, you might see a default empty stage. If not, go to `File -> New`.
3.  **Add a Ground Plane:**
    *   In the "Create" menu (left side of the UI), navigate to "Physics" -> "Ground Plane" and add it to the scene.
4.  **Import a Pre-built Humanoid Model:**
    *   In the "Content" window (bottom left usually), navigate to `Isaac -> Robots -> Humanoids`.
    *   Drag and drop a humanoid model (e.g., `franka_humanoid_example.usd` or similar provided example) into your scene.
    *   Position the humanoid model on the ground plane (e.g., set its Z position slightly above the ground if it spawns below).
5.  **Start and Stop Simulation:**
    *   Locate the "Play" button (green triangle) in the top menu bar (often near the "Simulation" tab).
    *   Click "Play" to start the physics simulation. Observe if the humanoid robot stands or falls (depending on its default configuration).
    *   Click "Stop" (red square) to end the simulation.
6.  **Explore the UI:**
    *   Select the humanoid model in the "Stage" window (left panel).
    *   Observe its properties in the "Property" window (right panel). Explore its components, prims, and attributes.
    *   Experiment with moving the camera around the scene (mouse controls: Alt + Left-click to orbit, Alt + Right-click to zoom, Alt + Middle-click to pan).

## Expected Output

*   A running instance of NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
*   A basic scene with a ground plane and an imported humanoid robot model.
