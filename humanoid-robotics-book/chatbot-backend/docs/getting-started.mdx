## Hands-on Labs

### Lab 1: Verify Ubuntu and Basic Utilities
1.  **Objective:** Confirm a successful Ubuntu installation and basic command-line functionality.
2.  **Instructions:**
    *   Open a terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T`).
    *   Run `lsb_release -a` to verify Ubuntu 22.04.
    *   Run `python3 --version` to check Python installation (should be 3.10.x).
    *   Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` to update your system.
    *   Install `git` if not already present: `sudo apt install git -y`.
    *   Verify `git` installation: `git --version`.

### Lab 2: Confirm NVIDIA Driver and CUDA Installation
1.  **Objective:** Ensure NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA Toolkit are correctly installed and detected.
2.  **Instructions:**
    *   Open a terminal.
    *   Run `nvidia-smi` to verify driver installation and GPU status. Note the CUDA version reported by `nvidia-smi` (this is the driver-API compatibility, not the toolkit version).
    *   Run `nvcc --version` to confirm the CUDA Toolkit installation and its version. This version should ideally match or be compatible with the CUDA version required by Isaac Sim or other deep learning frameworks you intend to use.
    *   (Optional) Run a CUDA sample to verify functionality: `cuda-install-samples-$(nvcc -V | grep -oP 'V\d+\.\d+' | cut -c 2-)/NVIDIA_CUDA-$(nvcc -V | grep -oP 'V\d+\.\d+' | cut -c 2-)/bin/x86_64/linux/release/deviceQuery`. Look for "Result = PASS".

### Lab 3: Validate ROS 2 Humble Setup
1.  **Objective:** Verify that ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill is correctly installed and configured.
2.  **Instructions:**
    *   Open a new terminal.
    *   Source the ROS 2 setup script: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`.
    *   Run a ROS 2 `talker` node: `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker`.
    *   Open a *second* terminal.
    *   Source the ROS 2 setup script: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`.
    *   Run a ROS 2 `listener` node: `ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener`.
    *   Observe messages being exchanged between the two terminals.

## Expected Output

*   A fully configured Ubuntu 22.04 system with NVIDIA GPU drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed.
*   Ability to run basic ROS 2 example nodes (`talker`/`listener`).
*   A functional Python environment ready for robotics and AI development.

## Assessment Questions

*   Why is an LTS (Long Term Support) version of Ubuntu recommended for ROS 2 development?
*   Explain the role of NVIDIA drivers and the CUDA Toolkit in accelerating AI and simulation tasks.
*   What is the purpose of sourcing the `setup.bash` file in ROS 2?
*   How do Python virtual environments contribute to better project management in robotics?

## Real-world Applications

*   **Robotics Development Labs:** Standardizing development environments for student projects and research.
*   **Industrial Automation:** Setting up consistent deployment targets for robot control software.
*   **AI/Machine Learning Engineering:** Ensuring reproducible research environments for model training and deployment.
*   **Embedded Systems Development:** Preparing cross-compilation environments for robotics hardware.
