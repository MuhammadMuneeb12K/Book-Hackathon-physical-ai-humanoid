title: 2.1 What Is a Digital Twin?
---
Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). In the evolving landscape of robotics, particularly with complex humanoid systems, the concept of a "digital twin" has become indispensable. This chapter introduces the core idea of a digital twin, its significance in robot development and deployment, and how it serves as a critical bridge between the virtual and physical worlds. Understanding digital twins is fundamental to building, testing, and optimizing humanoid robots efficiently and safely.

## Goal

The goal of this chapter is to teach students what a digital twin is, its theoretical underpinnings, and its practical importance in the development, testing, and deployment of humanoid robots, using simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity.
