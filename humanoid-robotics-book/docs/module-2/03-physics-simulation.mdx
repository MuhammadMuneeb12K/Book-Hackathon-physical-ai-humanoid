title: 2.3 Physics Simulation (Gravity, Rigid Bodies, Collisions)
---
Having set the stage by building our Gazebo world, we now dive into the core of realistic simulation: the physics engine. For humanoid robots, accurate physics simulation is paramount, as it dictates how the robot interacts with its environment, maintains balance, and executes dynamic movements. This chapter will explore how Gazebo models fundamental physical phenomena like gravity, rigid-body dynamics, and collisions, enabling you to create truly physics-accurate simulations for your humanoid systems.

## Goal

The goal of this chapter is to teach students how to configure and utilize the physics engine within Gazebo to create physics-accurate humanoid simulation environments, focusing on gravity, rigid-body dynamics, and collision detection to realistically model robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand the role of Gazebo's physics engine in simulating realistic robot behavior.
*   Learn to configure global physics properties such as gravity and simulation update rates.
*   Grasp the concept of rigid bodies and how they are defined through inertial properties in SDF/URDF.
*   Implement accurate collision detection using simplified geometries for efficient simulation.
*   Understand and configure friction, restitution, and damping for realistic contact interactions.
*   Debug and troubleshoot common physics-related issues in Gazebo simulations.

## Prerequisites

*   A functional Gazebo world from the previous chapter.
*   Familiarity with URDF/SDF concepts, especially `<link>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>` elements.
*   Basic understanding of classical mechanics (mass, inertia, gravity, friction).

## Key Concepts

*   **Physics Engine:** The software component responsible for calculating the physical interactions between objects in a simulation (e.g., forces, torques, velocities, positions). Gazebo typically uses ODE, Bullet, DART, or Simbody.
*   **Gravity:** The force of attraction that causes objects to fall towards the center of a celestial body. Configurable in Gazebo.
*   **Rigid Body:** An object in simulation whose shape and mass distribution are assumed to be fixed, meaning it does not deform.
*   **Inertial Properties:** Characteristics of a rigid body that describe its resistance to changes in motion, including mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor. Defined in the `<inertial>` tag.
*   **Collision:** The event when two or more objects come into contact, resulting in an exchange of momentum and energy.
*   **Collision Geometry:** The simplified 3D shape used by the physics engine to detect contacts between objects, often different from the visual mesh. Defined in the `<collision>` tag.
*   **Contact Dynamics:** The set of rules governing how objects respond to collisions, including friction and restitution.
*   **Friction:** A force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact.
*   **Restitution (Bounciness):** A measure of how much kinetic energy is conserved during a collision (0 = perfectly inelastic, 1 = perfectly elastic).
*   **Damping:** A force that opposes motion, often used to simulate air resistance or energy dissipation in joints.
*   **Sim-to-Real Gap:** The discrepancy between simulated and real-world physics, often minimized by accurate physics configuration.

## Tools

*   **Gazebo (Ignition Fortress):** The simulation environment.
*   **SDF (Simulation Description Format):** For defining physics properties.
*   **URDF:** For defining robot inertial properties.
*   **Gazebo GUI:** For inspecting physics properties and visualizing contacts.

**Prerequisites:** Completed Lab 2.2.1 (`simple_room.world` and its launch file).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Modify `simple_room.world`:** Add a spherical model with appropriate inertial and collision properties.

      </world>

    ```
2.  **Rebuild your `my_gazebo_worlds` package (not strictly necessary for just world changes, but good practice):**
    ```bash
    cd <your_ros2_ws>
    colcon build --packages-select my_gazebo_worlds
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
3.  **Launch your custom Gazebo world:**
    ```bash
    ros2 launch my_gazebo_worlds launch_room.launch.py
    ```
    Observe the ball falling in the modified gravity and bouncing off the ground plane and potentially the table/walls. Experiment with changing `gravity` and `restitution_coefficient` values in the `.world` file and re-launching to see their effects.

### Lab 2.3.2: Applying External Forces to Objects in Gazebo

**Objective:** Use ROS 2 commands to apply an external force to the ball in your Gazebo world, simulating an impulse.

**Prerequisites:** Running Gazebo world from Lab 2.3.1.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Ensure your `simple_room.world` is running with the `bouncing_ball` model.**
2.  **Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 environment:**
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
3.  **Use the `ros2 service call` command to apply a force to the ball's link.** Gazebo provides services for interacting with models. We'll use the `/gazebo/apply_link_wrench` service (available if `ros_gz_sim` is configured correctly and connected to Gazebo).

    *Note: The exact service name and message type might depend on your `ros_gz_sim` bridge configuration. For Ignition Gazebo, you might need to use `gz topic pub /world/simple_humanoid_room/cmd_wrench ignition.msgs.Wrench` for direct Ignition commands if `ros2 service call` doesn't work directly with the bridge.*

    For `ros_gz_sim`, the service usually follows the pattern: `/world/<world_name>/set_link_wrench`. Let's assume the bridge handles a direct ROS 2 service call to `/gazebo/apply_body_wrench` (this can vary; check `ros2 service list` for available services once Gazebo is running).

    A more reliable ROS 2 way to apply wrench would be to publish to the `~/wrench` topic of the model.

    **Using `ros_gz_sim` topic for wrench:**
    *   **In a new terminal, source ROS 2, and publish a wrench message:**
        ```bash
        source install/setup.bash
        # Identify the correct topic for the wrench. For Ignition, it's typically /model/bouncing_ball/link/ball_link/wrench
        # Check available topics: `ros2 topic list | grep wrench`
        # Assuming the topic name is /model/bouncing_ball/cmd_wrench, which is common for `ros_gz_sim`
        ros2 topic pub /model/bouncing_ball/cmd_wrench ignition.msgs.Wrench "{force: {x: 10.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, torque: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, force_offset: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, torque_offset: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, duration: {sec: 1, nanosec: 0}}" --once
        ```
        This command applies a 10 Newton force along the X-axis for 1 second. Observe the ball's reaction in Gazebo. Experiment with different force magnitudes and directions.

## Expected Output

*   A Gazebo world where objects exhibit realistic physical behavior (falling, bouncing, sliding).
*   Ability to modify global gravity and observe its effects.
*   Understanding of how inertial properties affect an object's response to forces.
*   Capability to apply external forces to simulated objects using ROS 2 commands.

## Assessment Questions

*   How does defining the `<inertial>` properties of a link in SDF/URDF contribute to the realism of a humanoid robot's simulation, particularly concerning balance and movement?
*   You observe objects interpenetrating in your Gazebo simulation. What are the common causes and how would you begin to debug this issue?
*   Explain the difference between `mu` and `mu2` in the `<friction>` tag for ODE physics.
*   Describe how the `max_step_size` and `real_time_factor` parameters in the `<physics>` tag impact the accuracy and speed of a Gazebo simulation.

## Real-world Applications

*   **Humanoid Gait Development:** Tuning gait parameters in simulation to ensure stability and efficiency under various gravity conditions (e.g., for extraterrestrial exploration).
*   **Robot Manipulation Tasks:** Simulating complex manipulation scenarios (e.g., grasping, pushing, lifting) to ensure collision-free and stable interactions with objects.
*   **Impact Testing:** Evaluating a robot's robustness and damage tolerance by simulating falls or impacts in a controlled environment.
*   **Balance Control Research:** Developing and testing advanced balance control algorithms for bipedal robots that can withstand external perturbations.

## Edge Cases

*   **Numerical Instability:** Very small `max_step_size` or large forces can lead to numerical instability in the physics engine, causing objects to "explode" or behave erratically.
*   **Missing or Incorrect Collision Geometries:** Objects might pass through others if their collision geometries are not defined or are too coarse.
*   **Bad Joint Limits:** Poorly defined joint limits or extreme joint efforts can lead to unrealistic joint behavior or instability.
*   **High-Frequency External Forces:** Applying very high-frequency forces without proper integration with the physics step size can lead to missed interactions or instability.
