# Specification Quality Checklist: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [specs/1-vla-robotics/spec.md](specs/1-vla-robotics/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Note: Contains domain-specific technology terms unavoidable for a chapter spec.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - *Note: Target audience is students learning VLA robotics, hence technical depth is appropriate.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Note: Contains domain-specific technology terms unavoidable for a chapter spec.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
